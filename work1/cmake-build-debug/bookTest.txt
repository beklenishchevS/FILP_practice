Russian is an East Slavic language, which is an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, as well
as being widely used throughout Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, the Caucasus and Central Asia. It was the de facto
language of the Soviet Union until its dissolution on 25 December 1991. Although nearly three decades have passed
since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russian is used in official capacity or in public life in all the post-Soviet
nation-states, as well as in Israel and Mongolia.
